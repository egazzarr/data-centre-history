            You are about to enter a very important space. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Since the 1950s, this room has hosted the main computing infrastructure of CERN’s experimental complex. The Data Centre is a central part of the history of CERN, and has seen the evolution of computing throughout all its significant eras. 
            <br/>
            This exhibition will walk you through the history of the Data Centre, explaining why CERN needed computers in the first place, by taking into account 3 main story lines: 
            <br/>
            STORAGE - the capability of saving physics data (in disks or tapes) before it is analysed, 
            <br/>
            COMPUTING - the processing power necessary to analyse physics data, 
            <br/>
            NETWORKING - the technology enabling scientists to access and transfer data not only on the CERN campus, but worldwide on the World LHC Computing Grid.       
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Are you ready?         
        </h1>

            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
    <h2>“When I came to CERN, my job was not only to find problems and solve them, 
        but also to try and convince the physicists that computers were <i>something useful</i>.”
        <br/>
        <i>Paolo Zanella, head of the Data Handling Division, 1976 </i></h2>

        
    <h2>"Suppose all the information stored on computers everywhere were linked. Suppose I could program my computer to create a space in which anything could be linked to anything. 
        All the bits of information in every computer at CERN, and on the planet, would be available to me and to anyone else. There would be a single, global information space”
    </br>
    <i>Tim Berners Lee, founder of the World Wide Web. 1989 </i></h2>
