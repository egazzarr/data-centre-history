            You are about to enter a very important space. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Since the 1950’s, this room has hosted the main computing infrastructure of CERN’s experimental complex. The Data Centre is a central part of the history of CERN, and has seen the evolution of computing throughout all its significant eras. 
            <br/>
            This exhibition will walk you through the history of the Data Centre, explaining why CERN needed computers in the first place, by taking into account 3 main story lines: 
            <br/>
            STORAGE - the capability of saving physics data (in disks or tapes) before it is analysed, 
            <br/>
            COMPUTING - the processing power necessary to analyse physics data, 
            <br/>
            NETWORKING - the internet technology enabling scientists to access and transfer data not only on the CERN campus, but worldwide on the World LHC Computing Grid.       
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Are you ready?         
        </h1>

    <h2>“When I came to CERN, my job was not only to find problems and solve them, 
        but also to try and convince the physicists that computers were <i>something useful</i>.”
        <br/>
        <i>Paolo Zanella, head of the Data Handling Division, 1976 </i></h2>
