                                Magnetic storage - tapes</u></p></a>
                            <p>

               Magnetic recording was invented by Danish engineer V. Poulsen in 1900, 
               and it started being used world-wide as a data a data-storage medium in the 50s. 
               The basic principle remains the same, irrespective of the year of manufacture; magnetic tapes are still 
               used at CERN as the main long-term storage medium. 
               The tape is covered with a magnetic pigment of ferromagnetic material like iron. 
               Ferromagnets consist of thousands of microscopic regions of uniform magnetic fields called domains.
               At the experiments' site at the time of the PS, data was recorded by passing an electrical signal close to the tape. 
               Due to Faraday's law, electrical current induces a magnetic field, which makes the ferromagnetic domains align in one direction.
               Each domain alignment represents a 1 or a 0 on the tape, making it possible to record information digitally in the form of bits. 
               The tapes were initially carried around by bike and brought to the Data Centre, 
               where operators would attach them to the computer; they were an inseparable part of the computer. 
               
               The data density a magnetic tape can holdis measured in BPI (bits per inch): in the 60s, most tapes were 200, 556 and 800 bpi. 
               With the arrival of the CDC 7600 mainframe in 1974, tapes with 1600 and 6250 BPI were introduced, with size up to 1 km in length.

                 Robotic tape libraries are used together with this helical scan recording drive, which sweeps across the tape every few micrometers with a rotating head. 
                 
                                 Many industries - from video, to satellite to seismic data - use magnetic tapes to store and back up data. 
                                 Information retrieval is quite slow and inherently sequential, as the whole tape needs to be windedbefore finding the desired section to be read; 
                                 however, it is to the present the most reliable and cheapest technology. 
                                 The tape cartridges evolved from a capacity of 10, 25, 50 Gb.

            A database is a way to organise and read data, allowing concurrent acess of multiple users. 
            At the time of punch cards, IBM mainframes had extension machines to organise the cards; this could be tought of as the earliest kind of databases.
            In the 1980s, relational databases became popular, introducing the concet of rows and columns. In the 1990s, object-oriented databasescame about. 
            Today, cloud databases hosted on cloud platforms are widely used, and the CERN Data Centre provides experiments with the database that best suits their needs.
