    Till today, magnetic storage is the most cost effective technology.

               Magnetic recording was invented by Danish engineer V. Poulsen in 1900, 
               and it started being used world-wide as a data a data-storage medium in the 50s. 
               The basic principle remains the same, irrespective of the year of manufacture; magnetic tapes are still 
               used at CERN as the main long-term storage medium. 
               The coil is covered with a magnetic pigment of ferromagnetic material 

               At the time of mainframes supercomputers, the data was recorded at the expriments' site in the form of electrical signals; the signal was converted into magnetic energy, 
               which imprinted the signal onto a moving coil covered in magnetic 
               They were carried around by bike and brought to the Data Centre, 
               where operators would attach them to the computer.
