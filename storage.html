    <h2>Not much has conceptually changed in storage technologies since the 50s, only the hardware's size and capacity.

    Till today, magnetic storage is the most cost effective technology.

    It is km long, and thin like your hair.

               Paper tape and teletypes
               Code and data was punched into rolls of paper with this machine, an were then fed into computers to read and process the code. 
               These were used at the time of the Ferranti Mercury. 

               1930s - 1970s
               Punched cards and IBM3000 Information Recorder
               German-American statistician Hollerith invented the recording of data on a medium that could then be read by a machine, 
               developing punched card data processing technology for the 1890 U.S. census. He git the idea by looking at a train ticket controller checking tickets. 
               In 1924, he founded International Business Machines Corporation (IBM). Punched cards are therefore older than computers!
               The first punch cards format had 80 columns and 12 rows. 
               columns 1 to 5, for example, were the label field, while 73 to 80 were left for comments. 
               If we were to save 1 TB of data (the capacity of your own personal computer, more or less) on punched cards, we would have to tie them together in a line long 
               enough to go around the whole world's conference for 64 times!
               Bubble chambers' codes at the time of the PS were mechanically queried by sticking a metal comb through the pile of cards. 
              
               1965
               Magnetic storage - coil bands
               Magnetic recording was invented by Danish engineer V. Poulsen in 1900, 
               and it started being used world-wide as a data a data-storage medium in the 50s. 
               The basic principle remains the same, irrespective of the year of manufacture; magnetic tapes are still 
               used at CERN as the main long-term storage medium. 
               The coil is covered with a magnetic pigment of ferromagnetic material like iron. 
               Ferromagnets consist of thousands of microscopic regions of uniform magnetic fields called domains.
               At the experiments' site at the time of the PS, data was recorded by passing an electrical signal close to the coil. 
               Due to Faraday's law, electrical current induces a magnetic field, which makes the ferromagnetic domains align in one direction.
               Each domain alignment represents a 1 or a 0 on th coil, making it possible to record information digitally in the form of bits. 
               The coils were initially carried around by bike and brought to the Data Centre, 
               where operators would attach them to the computer. 
               The data density a magnetic coil can holdis measured in BPI (bits per inch): in the 60s, most coils were 200, 556 and 800 bpi. 
               With the arrival of the CDC 7600 mainframe in 1974, coils with 1600 and 6250 BPI were introduced, with size up to 1 km in length.
               

               Magnetic Storage - first automation 
               These beehive structures hosted magnetic bands, that were retrieved and unrolled to read the data by the first automated system, that comprised a robotic arm that was pinching them. 

               Magnetic storage - tapes
               Information retrieval is quite slow and inherently sequential, but the most reliable and cheap. 
               In the <a href="https://information-technology.web.cern.ch/sites/default/files/CERNDataCentre_KeyInformation_Nov2021V1.pdf">2021 report</a>, 32244 were reported 
               to be in the Data Centre, with about 380 PB used.
