## CERN Data Centre history - a simple website
My research on the CERN computing history, and how technologies have evolved since the 50s at the service of physics. Started being developed with Github actions [here](https://egazzarr.github.io/data-centre-history/), but then transitioned to [official CERN website](https://computing-exhibit.web.cern.ch/).
