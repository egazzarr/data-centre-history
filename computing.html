    <h2>The history of computing at CERN is representative of the evolution of technologies that affect us all today. 
        Here some objects that tell the story from the 50s: processors, laptops, phone did not exists, and vacuum tubes computers filled entire rooms. 
        Computing at CERN was first dependent on big,heavy, mainframe supercomputers (one for all - CDC, CRAY, IBM). 
        In the 70s, proprietary mini-computers (DEC PDP/VAX, HP, Norsk Data) appeared: with these, the experiments were able to send their data to the Data Centre more quickly, and "digitalise" the geometry of particle physics collisions. 
        In the 80s, Work Stations (Apollo, Sun, silicon Graphics, UNIX boxes) allowed for the first time physicists to see results on a screen. 
        In the 90s, distributed computing became a must, and the mainframe computers were replaced by computer farms made of personal computers like the ones everyone has intheir home nowadays.

                                Before computers, CERN hired the Dutch prodigee mathematician as a human calculator. 
                                He was fster than the first analogue calculators at the time, and was getting tired extremely quickly. 
                                On 27 August 1976, Klein calculated the 73rd root of a 500-digit number in 2 minutes and 43 seconds, winning a place in the Guinness Book of Records.
                                He was unfortunately stabbed to death in his apartment by an unidentified individual.

                                The first CERN computer, which was filling a whole room, took 2 years to build and 3 months to install. 
                                It was one million times slower than today's large computers and it costed 1 million Swiss Francs of the time. 
                                The Ferranti Mercury works on the principle of vacuum tubes, ampoules with an anode (positive) and a cathode (negative). 
                                When powered with current, heat makes electron flow from anode to cathode, carrying and amplifying the signals through a gate in the middle (anode, cathode and gate contitute what was called a triode).  
                               
                                <!-- The first vacuum tubes computer was designed in 1926 in Germany with the purpose of tax avoidance; in fact, 
                                radio receivers had a tax that was levied depending on how many tube holders a radio receiver had. This solution allowed 
                                radio receivers to have a single tube holder. -->

                            <p>
                                Until the 90s, most of the  Data Centre was filled with one large mainframe computer, which was in charge of running all of the physics and engineering workloads of CERN. 
                                CERN was a desirable client for early supercomputer companies such as IBM and CRAY, and therefore was always getting the latest machines at competitive prices. 

                                Still, the mainframes were very expensive: around $5 millions for one of them. 
                                The IBM 790 (1961) and later IBM 7090 (1963) ran the first "FORTRAN" ("FORmula TRANSlating") programs written on punch cards, analysing measurements from bubble chambers. 
                                CERN hired around 2000 young women - the scanning girls - whose job was to scan the bubble chambers' pictures and get the coordinates of particles' traces by hand.  
                                Many physicists and engineers ended up marrying them. 

                                The most powerful IBM mainframe CERN had was the IBM 3090 (1985 - 1996). 
                                Here you can see a water-cooled Thermal Conduction Module (TCM) was used on the mainframes. It is made of ceramics, which is geometrically stable and can be fine-tuned to the temperature, 
                                but at the same time very hard to produce and therefore extremely expensive. 
                                Ceramics can also be made of multiple layers compared to plastic boards. 
                               
                                Each ceramic plate has 63 layers, weights around 2 kg and holds 2772 gold pins, resting on the chips inside. 
                          
                                The rubber tubes brought water to the pins which rested on the chips. The heated water was then circulated out and away.

                            <p>
                                With the advent of the CDC 6600 (1965) the process of scanning and sending bubble chamber tracks to the mainframe was automated for the first time. 
                                <b>Transistors</b> (officially invented in 1947) also replaced vacuum tubes, a huge leap in technology. 
                                They are both devices to control the flow of electrons (current); in vacuum tubes electrons are the only charge carriers, while in transistors the charge carriers
                                are both electrons and holes, which flow between 3 semiconducting layers. 
                                Here, a cordwood module from the CDC 6600, containing 64 silicon transistors.  
                                Resistors seem to be stacked like cord between the two circuit boards in order to obtain a high density.
                                The second object, a black module with its corresponding plate, composed the later CDC 7600 (1972) mainframe, which provided the bulk of the computing power needed by CERN for almost 12 years. 
                                No system has ever lasted so long since then.
                                By the 70s, computers of various kinds spread at CERN: by 1974, 150 computers of various sizes are reported to be installed on CERN campus. 
                                - small mini-computers (PDP8, HP2115A) 
                                - larger mini's and control computers (PDP11/45, HP4100, Nord-10, IBM1800, Modular One, Ferranti Argus 500) 
                                - medium sized computers (PDP-10, IBM-360/44, CII 10070 and CDC 3200)
                                - large computers (CDC 6600, CDC 7600).
                                Computing becomes more heterogeneous.

                            SecurID is a mechanism developed by Security Dynamics that allows two-factor authentication for a user on a network resource; it was necessary to run analyses on the CRAY supercomputers. 
                            The first Unix system dates back to 1981, but it was mounted on CRAY supercomputers and replaced their CRAY OS, which was proprietary.  
                            CERN helped CRAY to install batch systems on their supercomputers, advancing technologies worldwide. By 1997, everything had transitioned to Unix and the computing model of CERN had changed. 
                            Seymour Cray was one of the founders of the company CONTROL DATA CORPORATION, producer of all the CERN's CDC mainframes, and later founded the CRAY COPMUTER CORPORATION. 
                            He enjoyed skiing, windsurfing, tennis, and other sports. Another favorite pastime was digging a tunnel under his home; he attributed the secret of his success to "visits by elves" while he worked in the tunnel: 
                            <i>"While I'm digging in the tunnel, the elves will often come to me with solutions to my problem."</i> When he was asked by management to provide detailed one-year and five-year plans for his next machine, he simply wrote:
                            <i>"Five-year goal: Build the biggest computer in the world. One year goal: One-fifth of the above."</i>

                        <p>
                            Mainframe computers were expensive (from $2 to $5 million at the time), so many engineers designed home-made integrated circuits to make them more performant than microprocessors on the market. 
                            These were called "emlators", as they emulated the functions of a mainframe, and they were 500 cheaper (one would cost around $10k at the time).
                            Notably, Antonio Fucci and his team were building wired up processors on a board like this one. 
                            Transistors were mounted on board with pins, and connected between each other with copper wires. 
                            The design was made on a computer and the computer program figured out the best way to thread the wires.

                        <p>
                            By joining many transistors for specific functions together with resistors and capacitors, in 1959 integrated circuits came about. 
                            Integrated circuits are the basis of all modern electronics and are contained in any electronic device in your hands. 
                            In 1971, microprocessors were invented, which are specific integrated circuits that contain the functions of a computer's central processing unit, namely a computer brain. 
                            The first microprocessor was the Intel 4004, a 4-bit chip. 
                            With the advent of microprocessors personal computers (PCs) are born, and scientists start developing on their own devices. 
                            The first microprocessor was the Intel 4004, a 4-bit chip. This means that 4 bits of information can be processed at the same time. Then came the 8-bit, 16-bit (on display: AMD 16-bit processor, 1982), 32-bit and 64-bit chips.
                            They are produced in thin wafers, like the round object on display. 
                            Microprocessors evolved from single core, meaning they could execute one instruction at a time, to multi-core. The first dual-core processor appeared in 2004. On display, the first multi core Itanium processor (2006) and
                            an Intel Core 2 Duo Processor E6600 (2.4 GHz) from 2010.

                            The first commercially available 32-bit computer, manufactured by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). The name "VAX" comes from an acronym for "Virtual address eXtension" as the successor to the PDP-11.
                            The mini-computers were the first to allow <a href="http://cds.cern.ch/record/862913?ln=e">online computing</a> in the control rooms of experiments, digitalisig the signals while they were taken. 
                            An important technological invention that revolutionised the way we interact with computers appeared in experiments' control rooms at the time of the first mini-computers, the Norsk-Data, in 1973: the first touch screen, 
                            invented by Ben Strumpe (you can see him in his office in the images). The big rolling black ball is a primordial mouse.

                        <a href="#"><p><u>Printed circuit boards</u></p></a>
                            <p>The wired up boards were first built by hand, then by a computer program. 
                                Later, the small components were actually printed on the board, facilitating the building procedure. 
                                These were boards that were inserted in mini-computers.  

                                Memory is an important part of computing, storing data temporarily. 
                                A ROM is used only to read a memory value that was programmed in it during masking (manufacture) based on the programmers needs. 
                               
                                The old PDP-11, used by many experiments, had a bootstrap ROM programmed by soldering in individual diodes. 
                                Each bit in this ROM Diode Matrix is represented by the presence or absence of one diode, determining whether you can read off its contents.
                                It represents a huge development as no longer need to toggle bootstrap in on the front panel switches.

                        A RAM (Random Access Memory), instead, is used to store a state or logic and it can read and write in different clock cycles. 

                        Here a magnetic memory from a mini-computer. 
                        Magnetic core memory was the predominant form of random-access computer memory for 20 years. 
                        It uses tiny magnetic toroids (rings), the cores, through which copper wires were hand-threaded to write and read information.
                        Each core represents one bit of information. The cores can be magnetized in two different ways (clockwise or counterclockwise) and the bit stored in a core is zero or one depending on that core's magnetization direction.
                        The wires are arranged to allow an individual core to be set to either a "one" or a "zero", and for its magnetization to be changed, by sending appropriate electric current pulses through selected wires. 
                        The process of reading the core causes the core to be reset to a "zero", thus erasing it.

                        Solid state (transistor or tube based) memory appeared in the 70s and was used in parallel to core memory. 
                        Core memory is slower, but needs very little energy and is very reliable. 
                        
                        RAM can be static or dynamic, In Static RAM (S-RAM), data is stored in transistors and requires a constant power flow. In Dynamic RAM (D-RAM), data is stored in capacitors and needs to be refreshed periodically.
                        Here, an S-RAM from 1989.

                            computations and they had high storage capabilities, with powerful compilers and networking support. They ran Unix as a operating system. 
                            They formed the first nodes of SHIFT, a distributed mainframe built on commodity hardware systems.

                            A single big expensive machine is replaced by large numbers of computers which are cheap, easy to replace, modular, and better to run in parallel particle physics analysis collisions (which are all independent from one another). 
                            To make them more efficient, a faster internet network is needed; in this environment, the transition to international interent standards and the development of the World Wide Web thrives.

                            As a 1st April joke, operators brought CERN's Director General in front of the Ferranti, and told him that he could ask the supercomputer any question in any language, and the computer would understand and spit out a result. 
                            W.K. was hiding behind the supercomputer wooden board and had access to controls. He also spoke 14 languages, so the trick was easily done.  </p></div>

                            The physics data journey was the following: at the experiments' site, the physics data was digitalised and recorded on magnetic tapes.  
                            Physicists would then carry the tapes by bike to the Data Centre window counter, and hand them to the operators along with punch cards, containing their code. 
                            The operators would queue the punch cards on the mainframe supercomputer, manually install the tapes, and the analyses would run. 
                            Bubble chambers are tanks of unstable (superheated) transparent liquid, sensitive to the passage of charged particles through it. 
                            As they force their way through the liquid, charged particles ionise the atoms in the liquid and they make it boil, leaving bubbling traces.

                            This was a first example of interactive analysis. 
                            Simulation software (GEANT 1,2,3,4) instead, focuses on generalising the geometry of a particle collision. 
                            ROOT, based on C++, allows to read data in chunks and modularly, and massively speeds up the anlaysis.
