    <h2><i>"I happened to come along with time, and the right interest and inclination, after hypertext and the Internet had come of age.
        The task left to me was to marry them together.        
        The philosophy was: what matters is in the connections. There really is little else to meaning. The structure is everything. [...] 
        Suppose all the information stored on computers everywhere were linked
        Suppose I could program my computer to create a space in which anything could be linked to anything. 
        All the bits of information in every computer at CERN, and on the planet, would be available to me and to anyone else. 
        There would be a single, global information space”</i> - Tim Berners Lee, father of the World Wide Web

mainframes, and retrieve their results.

                            enabled connecting a dumb terminal with a computer port. 
                        The decimal switches you can see served to decide which computer you wanted to connect to.
                        
                        This switch had a modem inside, a system to encode and decode (analogue to digital) signals over copper telephone lines.
                        These were produced by Gandaf, a Canadian company that ran out of business with the arrival of Ethernet technologies. 
                        On the side, you can see more modern examples (1990s, 2000s) of modems, used to connect a computer to the internet via telephone lines. 

                        With the advancement of technologies, modems have become small chips that fit within your smartphone.

                        <p>   
                            CERN decided to create its own internal network, one of the world's fastest networks. 
                            This is a home-made (like most avant-garde technologies at the time) interface with 15 data links to a CERNET switching node, a Modcomp computer, used for packet switching. 
                            Each end system had a data link coming in to the Modcomp. 
                            Each data link transfers data full duplex at 2.5Mbit/s. 
                            Once fully deployed, CERNET interconnected the central IBM and CDC mainframes to switching node computers, the Modcomp Classics (represented by the small squares in the map, 1980). 
                            There were then connected to over 100 mini-computers (represented by the small dots).
                        The data was travelling through thick twisted pair cables for a maximum of 1 km, after which it was lost as the resistance in the wires, made of copper, was too strong. 
                            All the CERNET protocols were developed independently, so it was hard to scale the data transfers.
                            The CERNET management cards, or interface cards, were built at CERN and since there was a lot of space on them, people printed their faces and poems on them.

                        The first CERNET user was the European Muon Collaboration experiment NA2, which used CERNET regularly from March 1978 to process data on the IBM 370 mainframe.

                            The STELLA project connected CERN, the Centro Nazionale Universitario di Calcolo Elettronico (Pisa, Italy), the Rutherford Laboratory (UK), the DESY physics laboratory (Hamburg), University College (Dublin, Ireland) and the Technical University (Graz, Austria) via ESA’s OTS satellite. CERN physics data (on magnetic tapes) were sent at 1Mbit/sec simultaneously to all active sites. Successful transfer of data was dependent on operators at the receiving endpoints, who had to timely mount magnetic tapes to record the data in real time. There was not enough disk or memory space to store the information, so data was written on tape on the fly. This added major overhead to data transfer operations. So in the final phase of the project, the system was used to inter-connect computer networks between some of the remote sites using a specially designed internet protocol.

                        As electrons flowed in the cables, they encountered resistance from the copper, therefore information
                        could only travel a maximum of 1 km. The faster information flowed, the shorter the distance it could travel. 
                        Computers were attached via these vampire taps (each around 100 CHF), connectors screwed straight through the shielding of the cable; when somebody needed to conect to the internet, 
                        they would open the "tap" and serve themselves.
                        The initial Ethernet technolgy was CSMA/CD, based on satellite protocols: all signals compete for the same satellite line. This is where the name "ethernet" comes from, as you were initialy transmitting the signal through the "ether", an arcaic word to describe the rarefied air in space. 
                        It then evolved from using coaxial cables to telephone cables to twisted pair to fibre optics cables.  -->

                        At CERN, the first widely used Local Area Network (LAN) was the 12 Mbit/s token ring network supporting the Apollo Domain and its powerful workstations, but this has now disappeared. 
                        Ethernet arrived at CERN in 1983 and it is still widely used nowadays. 

                        It is a computer networking technology developed in XEROX Parc in Palo Alto (CA, US). 
                        It allows linking devices together by running cables in a local area network (LANs) or wide area network (WANs).
In the beginning, Ethernet used thick yellow coaxial cables that could stand humidity. Computers were attached via these “vampire taps” (each costing around 100 CHF), connectors screwed straight through the shielding of the cable; when somebody needed to conect to the Etherrnet, they would open another "tap" and serve themselves. The initial Ethernet technology was “Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detect” CSMA/CD, based on satellite protocols: all connected systems competed for the same satellite channel and detected and corrected for possible collisions. This is where the name "ethernet" comes from - you were transmitting the signal through the "ether", an archaic word to describe the rarefied air in space. But this technology was limited to cables under 1.2 km in length and to speeds between 3 and 10 Mbits/sec.

Ethernet then evolved from using shared coaxial cables to using switched twisted pair telephone cables and then to fibre optics cables. Speeds today reach Gigabits/sec.

                        If instead you sense that the resource is occupied, you back off randomly and you re-transmit.  -->

                            Before routing boxes, Internet routing was slow as it was done in some of the host computers themselves, and not on dedicated devices. 
                            The idea of having a dedicated box for IP routing (initially used to connect geographically disparate computers over a multiprotocol network system) 
                            was extremely new when “cisco systems” was founded in 1984 by Len Bosack and Sandy Lerner in California.

This Cisco MGS router was probably the first Cisco router in Europe. 
It had IP filtering capabilities which helped to protect CERN’s CRAY mainframes from unauthorised communications to or from other networks. 
It became redundant with the end of life of the CRAY, but it is today a priceless treasure. Nowadays, the most modern routers are these Juniper routers, that transmit
information 100,000 times faster than the first Cisco router.

                        TCP/IP enabled the integration of various networks into a global network of networks, while before each university/institute used their own internet protocol. 
                        The TCP/IP protocol suite also facilitated the development of other protocols and applications that run on top of it, such as the Domain Name System (DNS), the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). 
                        In general, four layers constitute an internet technology: 
                        the physical layer (Ethernet or token ring), 
                        the network layer (IP), 
                        the correction layer (TCP) and the application layer.

                        The idea of having a dedicated box for IP routing (initially used to connect geographically disparate computers over a multiprotocol network system) was extremely new.

                        CISCO was co-founded by Len Bosack in 1986, and this CISCO router was probably the first CISCO router in Europe.

                        It became redundant with the end of life of the CRAY, but it is a priceless treasure. Nowadays, the most modern routers are these Juniper routers, that transmit information 100000 times faster than the first ISCO router.  -->

                        <p>   
                            Tim Berners Lee had been working for years on a hypertext (Ted Nelson, 1960) system that would allow anyone to access information over the internet, from anywhere. 
                            In the beginning, he struggled to convince CERN scientists and management that the Web was a useful solution to information sharing (<i>"Friends at CERN gave me a hard time, 
                            saying it would never take off - especially since it yielded an acronym that was nine syllables long when spoken. Nonetheless, I decided to forge ahead. 
                            I would call my system the "World Wide Web"</i> - T.B.L.). 
                            It all came together when he finished coding the Web, copmrised of a browser (the client), a server, a naming scheme (URL), a hypertext markup scheme (HTML), and a transport protocol (HTTP) on Christmas day, the 25th December 1990. 
                            He coded it in objective C on his NeXT (founded by Steve Jobs) machine (<i>"The NeXT interface was beautiful, smooth, and consistent. It had great flexibility [...]. Its failure to take over the industry, despite all these advantages, 
                            became for me a cautionary tale. NeXT required users to accept all these innovations at once -- too much."</i> T.B.L.). The very first website in the world was <i>info.cern.ch</i>. 
                            In 1992, Tim put the Web's specifications on USEnet, a global network of software developers; everyone soon realised the innovation that the invention would apport to society, 
                            and actively engaged in its development, which happened in a real grass-roots fashion. 
                            In 1993, the MOSAIC project (Mozilla, Firefox nowadays) developed a version of the Web that was running on any PC, while Tim's Web was only running on NeXT machines. 
                            With MOSAIC, the whole world understood the potential of the WWW. 
                            In 1994, Tim left for MIT and the Web development was moved to the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) with the US part in Boston. The EU part, expected to be at CERN, was moved to INRIA in Grenoble. 
                            By the time of the first Internet convention, the Web had more than 10000 servers and 10 million users. 
                            In 1995, Microsoft finally accepts the Web and launches "Internet Explorer".

                            Nowadays, CIXP is the main internet exchange point in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, with connections to most of the major national and international Internet Service Providers.

                            In glass cables, information and data are transported through photons (light). 
                            Fibres are used instead of metal wires because signals travels at higher bandwidths (data rates) along them with less loss, and are immune to electromagnetic interference.
                            This is useful for somewhere like CERN where magnets with their highly powerful magnetic fields could pose a problem.
                            The coating is in plastic, the cladding and core are transparent, reflecting completely the light inside, so that n information is lost (total internal reflection). 
                            At CERN, the fibre optic cables are sometimes blown inside tubes. 
                            The fibres can be multi-mode (shorter distances, more information carried simultaneously, useful for data centres, ~ 50 micrometres core) or single mode (longer distances, ~ 9 micrometres core); the core is always thinner than a hair!
                            In order to change the speed of th information transmission, it is not necessary to change the whole cable, but there are “boosters” to raise the transmission speed.

                            The first service of the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG), called LCG-1 was opened in 2003, with 25 sites worldwide; it was , to .
                            set up to share LHC resources for physics analyses across the world, both in terms of storage and computing resources to spread analysis calucaltions 
                            over various computing nodes. 
                            It was also built to dilute the cost of computing, which was becoming consederably high with the preparation of the first LHC run. 
                            WLCG combines about 1.4 million computer cores and 1.5 exabytes of storage from over 170 sites in 42 countries. 
                            This massive distributed computing infrastructure provides more than 12 000 physicists around the world with near real-time access to LHC data, 
                            and the power to process it.
                            It runs over 2 million tasks per day and, at the end of the LHC’s LS2, global transfer rates exceeded 260 GB/s.
                            CERN provides about 20% of the resources of WLCG.
