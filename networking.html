    <h2><i>"I happened to come along with time, and the right interest and inclination, after hypertext and the Internet had come of age.
        The task left to me was to marry them together.        
        The philosophy was: what matters is in the connections. There really is little else to meaning. The structure is everything. [...] 
        Suppose all the information stored on computers everywhere were linked
        Suppose I could program my computer to create a space in which anything could be linked to anything. 
        All the bits of information in every computer at CERN, and on the planet, would be available to me and to anyone else. 
        There would be a single, global information space”</i> - Tim Berners Lee, father of the World Wide Web

                            CERN decided to create its own internal network, one of the world's fastest networks. 
                            This is 15 datalinks of a CERNET node. Each data link transfers data full duplex at 2.5Mbit/s. 
                            Once fully deployed, CERNET interconnected the central IBM and CDC mainframes and over 100 mini-computers.
                            All the CERNET protocols were developed independently, so it was hard to scale the data transfers.
                            The CERNET management cards, or interface cards, were built at CERN and since there was a lot of space on them, people printed their faces and poems on them.

                        The recording, on magnetic tape, of raw data generated by physics experiments was still done on minicomputers local to the experiment. 
                        The first CERNET user was the European Muon Collaboration experiment NA2, which used CERNET regularly from March 1978 to process data on the IBM 370 mainframe. 
                        In the map, from 1980, each small dot represents a user mini-computer, usually in an experimental hall or development laboratory, connected by a
                        thick data link to a CERNET node computer. Each small square represents a
                        pair of node computers, which are Modcomp Classics. The inter-node connections are represented by the thicker lines, which
                        represent two or more data-links, coming out of the Data Centre.  
                        The data was travelling through thick twisted pair cables for a maximum of 1 km, after which it was lost as the resistance in the wires, made of copper, was too strong.

                            Before the arrival of ethernet, physics data was sent with antennas to satellites. The STELLA project was connecting CERN, the Centro Nazionale Universitario di Calcolo Elettronico (Pisa, Italy) and the Rutherford Lab (UK).
                            Private customers were only allowed to receive data, while experiments sent data to users. The transfer of data was dependent on operators at the receiving endpoint, who had to timely mount a manetic tape to record data in real time. 
                            There was not enough memory to actually store the information, so data was read on the fly. This added major overhead to data transfers operations.

                        At CERN, the first widely used Local Area Network (LAN) was the 12 Mbit/s token ring
                        network supporting the Apollo Domain and its powerful workstations.

                            <!-- Ethernet (10 Mbit/s) arrived in 1983, using different types of coaxial cables, followed by a
                            token passing ring at 4 Mbit/s for LEP controls in 1986 and much later by
                            FDDI at 100 Mbit/s on optical fibre cables.  -->

                        Ethernet arrived at CERN in 1983 to avoid satellite data collision transfers and it is still widely used nowadays. 
                        It is a computer networking technology developed in XEROX Parc in Palo Alto (CA, US). 
                        It allows to link devices together by running cables in a local area network (LANs) or wide area network (WANs).
                       
 
                        <b>IP/TCP protocol</b>, invented in 1973 by Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn to replace ARPANET's Network Control Protocol (NCP) was designed to be the go-to protocol to transfer information over th einternet. 

                        </br>
                        TCP/IP enabled the integration of various networks into a global network of networks, while before each university/institute used their own internet protocol. 
                        The TCP/IP protocol suite also facilitated the development of other protocols and applications that run on top of it, such as the Domain Name System (DNS), the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). 
                        </br>
                        Before routing boxes, internet routing was slow as it was done done in some of the host computers themselves, and not on dedicated devices. 
                        The idea of having a dedicated box for IP routing (initially used to connect geographically disparate computers over a multiprotocol network system) was extremely new.
                        </br>
                        CISCO was co-founded by Len Bosack in 1986, and this CISCO router was probably the first CISCO router in Europe.
                        It had IP filtering capabilities to protect CERN’s CRAY mainframes from unauthorised communications to or from other networks.
                        It became redundant with the end of life of the CRAY, but it is a priceless treasure. Nowadays, the most modern routers are these Juniper routers, that transmit information 100000 times faster than the first ISCO router.

                            In the beginning, Ethernet used these thick coaxial cables that could stand humidity. 
                        As electrons flowed in the cables, they encountered resistance from the copper, therefore information
                        could only travel a maximum of 1 km. The faster information flowed, the shorter the distance it could travel. 
                        Computers were attached via these vampire taps (each around 100 CHF), connectors screwed straight through the shielding of the cable; when somebody needed to conect to the internet, 
                        they would open the "tap" and serve themselves.

                            Tim Berners Lee had been working for years on a hypertext (Ted Nelson, 1960) system that would allow anyone to access information over the internet, from anywhere. 
                            In the beginning, he struggled to convince CERN scientists and management that the Web was a useful solution to information sharing (<i>"Friends at CERN gave me a hard time, 
                            saying it would never take off - especially since it yielded an acronym that was nine syllables long when spoken. Nonetheless, I decided to forge ahead. 
                            I would call my system the "World Wide Web"</i> - T.B.L.). 
                            It all came together when he finished coding the Web, copmrised of a browser (the client), a server, a naming scheme (URL), a hypertext markup scheme (HTML), and a transport protocol (HTTP) on Christmas day, the 25th December 1990. 
                            He coded it in objective C on his NeXT (founded by Steve Jobs) machine (<i>"The NeXT interface was beautiful, smooth, and consistent. It had great flexibility [...]. Its failure to take over the industry, despite all these advantages, 
                            became for me a cautionary tale. NeXT required users to accept all these innovations at once -- too much."</i> T.B.L.). The very first website in the world was <i>info.cern.ch</i>. 
                            In 1992, Tim put the Web's specifications on USEnet, a global network of software developers; everyone soon realised the innovation that the invention would apport to society, 
                            and actively engaged in its development, which happened in a real grass-roots fashion. 
                            In 1993, the MOSAIC project (Mozilla, Firefox nowadays) developed a version of the Web that was running on any PC, while Tim's Web was only running on NeXT machines. 
                            With MOSAIC, the whole world understood the potential of the WWW. 
                            In 1994, Tim left for MIT and the Web development was moved to the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) with the US part in Boston. The EU part, expected to be at CERN, was moved to INRIA in Grenoble. 
                            By the time of the first Internet convention, the Web had more than 10000 servers and 10 million users. 
                            In 1995, Microsoft finally accepts the Web and launches "Internet Explorer".

                            The CERN Internet eXchange Point, CIXP, was the first ever European Internet hub. By 1991, 80% of Europe's Internet network traffic was passing through CERN.
                            Nowadays, CIXP is the main internet exchange point in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, with connections to most of the major national and international Internet Service Providers.

                            Network cards are inserted in computers to connect over the internet.

                            In glass cables, information and data are transported through photons (light). 
                            Fibres are used instead of metal wires because signals travels at higher bandwidths (data rates) along them with less loss, and are immune to electromagnetic interference.
                            This is useful for somewhere like CERN where magnets with their highly powerful magnetic fields could pose a problem.
                            The coating is in plastic, the cladding and core are transparent, reflecting completely the light inside, so that n information is lost (total internal reflection). 
                            At CERN, the fibre optic cables are sometimes blown inside tubes. 
                            The fibres can be multi-mode (shorter distances, more information carried simultaneously, useful for data centres, ~ 50 micrometres core) or single mode (longer distances, ~ 9 micrometres core); the core is always thinner than a hair!
                            In order to change the speed of th information transmission, it is not necessary to change the whole cable, but there are “boosters” to raise the transmission speed.

                            The first service of the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG), called LCG-1 was opened in 2003, with 25 sites worldwide; it was , to .
                            set up to share LHC resources for physics analyses across the world, both in terms of storage and computing resources to spread analysis calucaltions 
                            over various computing nodes. 
                            WLCG combines about 1.4 million computer cores and 1.5 exabytes of storage from over 170 sites in 42 countries. 
                            This massive distributed computing infrastructure provides more than 12 000 physicists around the world with near real-time access to LHC data, 
                            and the power to process it.
                            It runs over 2 million tasks per day and, at the end of the LHC’s LS2, global transfer rates exceeded 260 GB/s.
                            CERN provides about 20% of the resources of WLCG.

                            The TCP/IP protocol suite consists of four layers: 
                            (i) the application layer (user applications, such as web browsers and email clients, communicate with each other)
                            (ii) the transport layer (TCP or UDP protocols ensure reliable - error corrected - or fast data transmission, respectively)
                            (iii) the internet layer (IP protocol routes the packets across different networks/ IP addresses) 
                            (iv) the network access layer (physical and data link protocols, such as Ethernet and Wi-Fi, connect the hosts to the network media)

                            The Web was immediately open source, "CERN relinquishes all intellectual property rights to this code, both source and binary and permission is given to anyone to use, duplicate, modify and distribute it.". 
                            The statement allowed anyone to claim ownership of the Web, making CERN vulnerable. 
                            These were years of raising awareness on the importance of software ownership, initially instigated by Richard Stallman (Free Software Foundation, GNU General Public Licence). 
                            François Fluckiger evaluated various options with CERN’s legal service and decided to release the new version as Open Source – CERN would retain the copyright to protect the 
                            software from appropriation as well as to secure attribution, but would grant to anyone the perpetual and irrevocable right to use and modify it, freely and at no cost.
