        <h2><i>How do we make sure we preserve scientific discoveries?</i></h2>

        <h3>CERN is one of the biggest scientific institutions in the world. This reputation comes with big responsibilities. Large scientific collaborations need to be able to access data and analyses from their predecessors simply. 
            Nowadays, all results being digital, it is crucial to have a system in place that ensures the reproducibility and sharing of scientific results throughout the years. 
            The Data Centre is the place where software like Zenodo, Indico and Reana are developed and maintained.

        <h1>Interview with Ben Segal</h1>
        <h2><i>“Unix and Internet evangelist” </i> - Tim Berners Lee</h2>

            <h3>What was the main challenge of accepting TCP/IP protocols at CERN and why were people against it? Why was there so much resistance against TCP/IP in the beginning - and it was allowed only within CERN’s domain? 
            <br/>
            Fear of an economic threat from the USA, particularly by European and other PTT monopolies. 
            Fear of disruption: this simple cheap technology replacing the diverse and expensive proprietary alternatives.
            Fear that CERN had no mandate to work in this sensitive techno/political domain.
            <br/>
            What did the STELLA project - that you managed- involved in the late 1970’s and early 80’s?
            <br/>
            It was a pre-Internet project trying to broadcast CERN data at high speed to partner labs via satellites.
            Almost all the required development had to be done by the partners themselves (5 physics laboratories). 
            <br/>
            What is MOSAIC and what is its novelty?  
            <br/>      
            The Web browser from Tim was running only on NeXT boxes, while MOSAIC ported it to personal IBM PCs and Unix machines. This made it accessible to a much wider public. MOSAIC became Netscape, then Firefox.
            <br/>
            How did you build a file-exchange gateway, in 1983, between the Apollo workstations and the homegrown CERNET network, which was at the time sufficient to exchange data and program files with the central CERN mainframes and other CERNET hosts?
            <br/>
            This was achieved by a collaboration between myself on the Apollo side and a colleague (Fabio Fabiani) who had developed a hardware gateway box allowing Ethernet hosts to connect to remote CERNET File Managers.
            <br/>
            Why was PC networking and IBM networking via TCP/IP ignored in the beginning? 
            <br/>
            Neither were CERN IT priorities. Both IBM PC’s and the IBM mainframes only communicated with proprietary protocols. The only mainframe computer to have TCP/IP on it was the CRAY (and some other Unix machines).
            <br/>
            The CERN Internet Exchange Point, CIXP, is the first European Internet hub ever existed. When was it installed, after the transition to IP protocols?
            <br/>
            Officially, it was installed in 1996, after some informal connections had been made starting in 1991/92.
            <br/>
            Can you tell me a bit more about emulators and how/why CERN built them? 
            <br/>
            They were built in the early 1980’s mainly because the standard (IBM 370 series) mainframe machines were too expensive to acquire enough capacity. They allowed fast execution of CERN offline and online IBM applications.
            <br/>
            When Unix systems became the standard they revolutionised the world of computing. What was there before, apart from the CRAY’s COS propriety operating system? 
            <br/>
            It was chaos! IBM, CRAY, Digital Equipment and a mass of other manufacturers, all with their own proprietary OS’s. They also had their own hardware, machine languages, data representations, etc, etc. UNIX was very revolutionary. 
            <br/>
            When you first bought the CISCO router’s IP filtering system, you write that you were impressed by it. What excited you, what was its novelty? 
            <br/>
            In 1987, when I first met the Cisco co-founder at an exhibition in the USA, the idea of a dedicated box for IP routing was very new. Before that, routing was usually done in some of the host computers themselves, and was slow. The Cisco box’s extra ability to filter the communications was extremely useful for security. So I bought two boxes for protecting the new CRAY machine at CERN.
            <br/>
            Before the whole of CERN converted to IP standards, CERN was using Class A addressing, with a single network (Network 100), chosen by you. Nowadays, you say that this is almost illegal. Why is this? 
            <br/>
            On the “real” Internet one has to obtain official IP numbers for all your networks from a central authority, but on an internal network with no real Internet connections you can assign any numbers you like. So between 1984 and the end of 1988 I personally issued and managed CERN’s IP numbering and all systems were on a single network, number 100 (the first number that came to my mind). This happens to be a Class A number.
            There are three classes of IP (v4) network addresses, A, B and C. The Class A networks are special, used for very large or historically important organisations. Class B are suitable for medium sized organisations like CERN, and Class C are used for small or domestic networks.
            It is nowadays very hard to obtain even class B networks, but in 1988 we easily obtained two (and later two more) Class B’s for CERN. We had to renumber everything before we connected to the real Internet.
            <br/>
            In 1987, why did you meet with Daniel Karrenberg, from the Mathematical Centre in Amsterdam.
            <br/>
            Yes, the Mathematical Center hosted “mcvax”, the European gateway of the USEnet system which supported email and bulletin boards for all Unix systems world wide.
            Daniel was looking for IP routers able to connect lines running over the European-favoured X.25 networks. His plan was to migrate the USEnet network from its confining network protocol “uucp” to TCP/IP, thus allowing connection to the whole Internet. I suggested he used CISCO routers. This allowed USEnet’s IP migration, without alerting the PTT’s. It was the first major step towards the European Internet, and to its governing body RIPE, first run by Daniel.
            <br/>
            Are NeXT machines an unmissable component of the exhibition on the history of the data centre?
            <br/>
            Of course, Tim had a beautiful machine and that's where he first developed the web. 
            <br/>
            Do you have other fun weird details about Tim Berners Lee? 
            <br/>
            His speech seemed nervous and was halting a lot, probably because he was hyperthreading and thinking about many things at once. He was difficult for many people to follow. Apart from being a visionary, he was also an excellent implementor, very persistent, and a master of making choices between many rival standards. 
            <br/>
            Is SHIFT - Scalable Heterogeneous Integrated Facility- worth including in the exhibition?  
            <br/>
            Yes, very much so! SHIFT marked the transition of high performance physics computing from the use of supercomputers - and mainframe computers in general - to using scalable networks of powerful workstations, the first example of heterogeneous distributed computing. This led directly to CERN’s Grid projects (WLCG) and to today’s cloud computing.
